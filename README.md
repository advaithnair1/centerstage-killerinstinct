# FTC Robotics Codebase README

This repository contains the codebase for an FTC (FIRST Tech Challenge) robotics team. The code is written in Java and is designed to operate a robot during both driver-controlled and autonomous periods of a competition. Additionally, it includes four autonomous programs, each targeting a specific starting position on the field.

## Requirements

- Android Studio (or any Java IDE)
- FTC SDK
- FTC Robot Controller app

## Autonomous Programs

- **centerstage_red_backdrop.java**: This program is specifically designed for the red alliance starting close to the backdrop.
- **centerstage_red_no_backdrop.java**: This program is specifically designed for the red alliance starting far from the backdrop.
- **centerstage_blue_backdrop.java**: This program is specifically designed for the blue alliance starting close to the backdrop.
- **centerstage_blue_no_backdrop.java**: This program is specifically designed for the blue alliance starting far from the backdrop.

Each autonomous program should include instructions to accomplish tasks and maneuvers based on the robot's initial position and game objectives.
